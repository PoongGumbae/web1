    <h1>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="js specification">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      <br>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
      <br>JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
      <br>The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
